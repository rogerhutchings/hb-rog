# hb-rog

My boilerplate setup for sites built with the Harp static generator. Gives you an extensible Bootstrap setup, RSCSS, and that's about it. Uses Jade by default, but Harp is pretty flexible about templating.

## Getting started

1. If you have Harp installed globally, you can use this repo as a boilerplate by running: `
harp init --boilerplate rogerhutchings/hb-rog`. If not, clone the repo into a new directory.

2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Kick off the local development server by running `npm start`
